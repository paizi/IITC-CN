## Developers

This Github page is for those interested in developing IITC further.

### Quickstart

To build the browser scripts from source you will need Python (either a late version 2.x, or 3.0+). It should
build correctly on Linux and Windows (and, probably, Macs, FreeBSD, etc)

Fork this project, clone to your local machine.

Run the `build.py local` script to build the code.

If all goes well, output of the build will end up in `build/local` subfolder.

You can create a custom build settings file, `localbuildsettings.py` - look in the supplied
`buildsettings.py` for details.

### Mobile

To build the mobile app, along with python, you will need

- The Java JDK (development kit - the runtime JRE is not enough)
- The Android SDK

Run `build.py mobile` to build IITC Mobile in debug mode.
